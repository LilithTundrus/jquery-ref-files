All the different visitor's actions that a web page can respond to are called events.

An event represents the precise moment when something happens.

Examples:

moving a mouse over an element
selecting a radio button
clicking on an element


The term "fires/fired" is often used with events. Example: 
"The keypress event is fired, the moment you press a key".
