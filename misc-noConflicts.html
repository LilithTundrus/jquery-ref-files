            As you already know; jQuery uses the $ sign as a shortcut for jQuery.

There are many other popular JavaScript frameworks like: Angular, Backbone, Ember, Knockout, and more.

What if other JavaScript frameworks also use the $ sign as a shortcut?

If two different frameworks are using the same shortcut, one of them might stop working.

The jQuery team have already thought about this, and implemented the noConflict() method.

You can also create your own shortcut very easily. The noConflict() method returns a reference to jQuery, that you can save in a variable, for later use.

        $.noConflict();
        jQuery(document).ready(function () {
            jQuery("button").click(function () {
                jQuery("p").text("jQuery is still working!");
            });
        });
