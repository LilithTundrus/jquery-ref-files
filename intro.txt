The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on a website.


jQuery is sort of legacy with the introduction of things like Angular or React
but it's still used in a lot of places and is very important to learn.

jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, a
nd wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, 
like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. (Or just makes them more terse)

The jQuery library contains the following features:

HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX
Utilities


jQuery is very extendable
